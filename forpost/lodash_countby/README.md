# lodash_countby

The count by method in lodash can be used to create an object that is a count of something for each element in a collection. This is the collection of source code examples that I have made for my [post on the lodash count by method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/06/04/lodash_countby/) as well as the vanilla javaScript alternatives that I have thus far.
