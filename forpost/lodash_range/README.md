# lodash_range

Here I have the source code examples, todo list, and these notes when it comes to what I am writing about for my [post on the lodash range method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/10/02/lodash_range/). There are actually two methods of interest in lodash that have to do with creating an array of numbers that are in a range. One of with is the lodash range method, and the other is the range right method, both of which do the same thing the only difference is the order of the numbers in the array. There may be a bit more to write about when it comes to other lodash method that can be used to do this sort of thing, and of course as always how to go about doing the same with just plain native javaScript by itself.
