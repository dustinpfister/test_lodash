# lodash_sum

These are some source code examples for my post on the [lodash sum method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/11/15/lodash_sum/). The lodash sum method will take an array of numbers and return a sum of that array. There are some draw backs such as the fact that this lodash method is not a collection method so in some cases I will need to convert an object to an array, it will also not work with arrays of arrays, and on top of that there are also a few native methods that work just as well for quickly creating a sum also.
