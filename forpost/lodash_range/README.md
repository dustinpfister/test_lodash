# lodash_range

Here I have the source code examples, todo list, and these notes when it comes to what I am writing about for my [post on the lodash range method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/10/02/lodash_range/). There are actually two methods of interest in lodash that have to do with creating an array of numbers that are in a range. One of with is the lodash range method, and the other is the range right method, both of which do the same thing the only difference is the order of the numbers in the array.
